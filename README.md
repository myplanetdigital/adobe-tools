### Actions

#### Sheedy Actions

`Prepare Selection for Sketch` outlines the stroke of the selection, unifies the path, converts it to a compound path and copies to the clipboard ready for pasting into [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) (uses the [wholePixelResize script](http://github.com/sheedy/adobe-tools/readme.md#wholePixelResize).

### Scripts

#### wholePixelResize

Proportionally resizes *width and height* of selection to nearest whole pixel value then scales *height* disproportionally to nearest whole pixel.
